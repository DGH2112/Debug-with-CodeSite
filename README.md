Description

This is a RAD Studio wizard / expert / plug-in which allow you to right click on
an identifier in the code editor and add a breakpoint which contains a
CodeSite.Send() evaluation expression so you can debug code with CodeSite without
having to alter the underlying code (useful for debugging RTL and the VCL).
